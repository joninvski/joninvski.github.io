description: I have been using git since 2007 and am so dependent on it that I have the motto, "if it is not tracked by git, it does not exist". Github is the perfect companion to git, allowing for multiple people to easily merge code via pull requests. I also heavily rely on github Issues as the perfect backlog for product development.
