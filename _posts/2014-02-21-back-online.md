After many years without updating thisblog.runsfreesoftware.com I'm keen on starting a new blog.

This time using Github to host it (saving me 12â‚¬ yearly) and having the advantage of not having to update drupal manually, let's see how all goes.

I'm going to use Jekkil, more specifically [Poole](http://getpoole.com) to setup the blog.

To force me to create content for the blog, I've downloaded the [habitbull android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oristats.habitbull&hl=en) and set the goal of a short post per day.

Let's see!
